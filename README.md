# Vitellaria-Paradoxa
Vitellaria paradoxa (C.F. Gaertn) is a woody plant native to the Guinea Savanna ecosystem of West Africa in which thousands of lives especially women in rural communities depend on for food, sources of energy and income. Unfortunately the rate at which the tree has been felled for charcoal production in the last few decades portend grave danger for both the environment and livelihood of people and therefore efforts to restore and conserve the tree is urgently required. The salient question here is where to obtain viable seeds for its propagation and restoration? This study applied remote sensing technology to extract vegetation related phenotypic data from satellite images (Landsat 8-9), and climate data using machine learning based species distribution model (SDM) to identify not only  the climatically suitable habitat of  V. paradoxa  but also where healthy and viable seed can be found through the spatial combination of thresholded suitability habitat map, thresholded vegetation indices, herein refer to as  seed zone  priority index  (SZPI) and seed zone map. The SZPI is expected to provide vital information necessary to guide in the collection of suitable and viable seeds require for the restoration and conservation of V. Paradoxa.
